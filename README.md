# Rock-Paper-Scissors
# This project follows The Odin Project's Foundations course. 

My Sudo Code Below:
# Create a function that encapsulates the array and randomization of the items within said array.
# Create an array of the selections (i.e. Rock, Paper, and Scissors).
# Create a randomizer, using Math.random().
# Create a function that starts the game.
# Create an input box, allowing for users to put in their input.
# Create an if-statement for whether the user wins or loses against the computer.
# Create a "Continue Playing" button, which resets the game, still invoking the first function in step 1.
